# maze-generator
Personal project Java program that initializes and fills a random maze. Utilizes theory of abstract data structures to perform a minimum-spanning-tree (Kruskalâ€™s) algorithm to fill walls so only one path exists between any two points of the maze. Created Spring semester of 2020, put here to showcase my programming abilities.
